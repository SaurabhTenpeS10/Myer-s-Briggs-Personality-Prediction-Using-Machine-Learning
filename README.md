# Myers-Briggs Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict Myers-Briggs personality types using machine learning. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a popular psychological tool that categorizes individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on four dichotomies: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving.
